<Notes>

Hello everyone!

We are extremely excited to be here in GoDays conference, and be able to speak about two topic we both love:

* Observability
* Programming in go

We hope our talk will be very inspiring and actionable for you.
This is because at the end of this talk we would like you to know 3 THINGS:

* Why instrumenting backend Go applications with actionable metrics is essential
* How to add metrics quickly in Go, how to test them
* And last but not the least: What are the common mistakes you should avoid, mistakes that
we seen a lot during our work with Go and metrics in the amazing (but sometimes WILD) OPEN SOURCE WORLD.

But before that: Short introduction!

Our job is focused on building scalable Observability solutions and platforms for OpenShift.
But also as one of the major part of our work is maintaining Prometheus and Thanos projects on a daily basis.
Those projects are focused on enabling monitoring via metrics for infrastructure, server side applications e.g
in microservices running on Kubernetes.

<Notes>

Today we have fun task! We will talk today about building loadbalancer. Kind of.

For demo purposes let's imagine we want to implement application level HTTP loadbalancer in Go?

Why? Well I could explain what role loadbalancer has these days, that it can distribute load evenly across many replicas
of the same microservice. I could mention that request based load balancing, in Layer 7, so application layer is beneficial because you has more
control, better insight, auditing capabilities, graceful shutdowns etc.

But let's instead implement loadbalancer because why not! FOR FUN.

1) So let's say we implemented transparent loadbalancer as presented in this diagram.
From high level design we have couple of Go components.

- Single HTTP server that implements ServeHTTP method, so handler via awesome ReverseProxy in standard httputil package.
- that ReverseProxy allows us to inject custom Transport, so RoundTripper interface.
- We inject there our load balancing RoundTipper implementation called lbtranport, which is internally
using then few components:
-- Discoverer which gives us targets to proxy / loadbalance request to
-- RoundRobinPicker which chooses right target to proxy user request to in FAIR, round robin manner, so: replica 1, 2,3, then again 1, 2, 3
-- And at the end it uses http.Transport to forward request to picked replica and proxy response back to the user.

<Notes>

This is great, it looks like this implementation should work.. but are we sure it's production ready?

So let's say we deploy couple of replicas of our loadbalancer in production in front of some microservice and let
it run for longer time.

As soon as it starts running, we hit /lb endpoint manually and we can see it works. So we are good, right?

Well...

<Notes>

As you can see there are massive amount of questions that would be not answered when running the service like this on
production, without proper monitoring.

That's why in SRE book you will find monitoring as the foundation of any system, BEFORE even the system itself!

As you might be familiar, some monitoring signals we can introduce are: traces, logs and metrics.
Guess which signal will give us answer to our questions like distribution of requests or histogram of tail latency?

<Notes>

Metrics, yup!

Metrics most likely give us the answers to our questions.
Answer that is in comparison to logs and traces:

1) CHEAPer to calculate
Near Real Time
Clear and Actionable, so you can alert on those.

In practice metrics should be the first item on monitoring list that you should do if you care to run your service reliably.

2) Why Prometheus though? Well I might be bias but Prometheus is currently one of the simplest and
cheapest option for collecting, storing and querying metrics as well as reliable alerting.
It is part of CNCF, fits for small solution as well as for bigger ones with help of cloud native projects like Thanos, Cortex, m3db and others

<Notes>

We can do that by incrementing some certain http_requests_total counter whenever a loadbalancing request occur
reporting method that was used, and HTTP status code that was returned.

We can introduce this metric really in few simple steps.

<Notes>

1) First of all we have to import Prometheus Go client library.
During our talk we will be talking mainly about Prometheus client Go module, which is designed to help
with instrumenting any Go application. It's tiny, heavily optimized and quite simple.

2) As a next step we need to define variable for the our counter of requests. We pick a name, a description
and certain "labels" which will be our dimensions for this counter. Each unique value in any of those labels will
result in totally new series in Prometheus system.

3) Next step is to actually count our requests. Let's create a simple wrapper of http server which will increment
the counter with the status code that the server returned and requested method.

4) Something that is easy to forget is another step: The counter has to be registered somewhere in order
to be exposed for Prometheus. Let's do this once in `init` function and register it in GLOBAL
Prometheus registry.

Let's focus on what we accomplish by registering this metric. It's important for the next step which is

5) HTTP handler for metric page. It serves simple text page with all metrics.
Once we add that to our loadbalancer, our server  is correctly exposing the http_requests_total counter
we created to the outside world.

</CodeSurfer>
<Notes>

1) How we can now use our metric? As you remember we defined this metric like this and we increment it every HTTP request.
2) Loadbalancer now serves /metrics page which exposes our metrics in Prometheus supported text format.
As you can see each code and method are a separate counter, with mostly successes.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 0px 10px 0 10px;">Prometheus can now collect metrics from our Loadbalancer</h2>

*Pulling e.g every 15 seconds*

<Notes>

We now can use running binary of Prometheus and point to the loadbalancer /metrics page. Prometheus then will
visit this page (which is called scrape) every given interval and collect all exposed metrics.

With that we can after some time, visit Prometheus UI where we can produce graphs. For example we can query
the number of requests per minute by code and method. We can see that per minute we have 120 requests in total,
with some small portion of those being error responses.

<Notes>

First one! Globals.

There was a saying in amazing Peter Bourgon blog post "A theory of Modern Go": magic is bad; global state is magic.

This is very true also in case of Prometheus client, especially if you are instrumenting some Go package with metrics
that your project, or maybe anyone in open source is using. This library allows you to use globals for certain simplicity
however the usage of it leaked as a pattern which we really really want to obsolete.

So let's focus on where you can have magic in our metrics and what can go wrong, on example of our loadbalancer in Go.

<Notes>

1) Let's take our example or http requests_total metric. We have 2 global states here.

2) As you can see metric is a global, package level variable. We register it once per package import as well.

3) Second place of global state is MustRegister which is actually hiding a Global DefaultRegisterer, so
we are registering out metric in global state of Prometheus library.

Now what's the issue here? Why is that problematic?

4) First problem is well magic.. If another package you just import, or you dependency imports registers a metrics
with the same name your application will crash at start.
Even worse the stacktrace will give you the clue where the second register happened but nothing about first one!
We have seen a lot of those problems, so please don't use globals (:

5) Second issue is lack of flexibility! What if you have more than one handler, more than one endpoint?

6) As you can see the insight you gain is pretty limited as the requests are counted per all endpoints. I can't tell
what's the error rate for /three endpoint for example.

Let's try to fix this!

7) And by fixing I mean removing globals!

8) Let's replace global variable with some struct that you can instantiate. It will have constructor that will create
our counter.

9) Now you can create such object and use it everywhere.

10) To eliminate last global behind registering, let's inject custom register into our constructor and instantiate
our own registry which we control in explicit way during our application lifetime!

11) Now what if we try to have different metrics for each handler? It will panic again, but there is nice solution
to that and since we are in control let's apply it.

12) Prometheus allows wrapping registry with custom prefix or labels, so we can inject handler label for each endpoint.

13) Now we have our metrics nicely grouped by handler as well, so we have additional crucial insight on what's
the number of requests per endpoint as well.

<Notes>

This is something I am really passionated about.
Metrics and other observability signals like e.g tracing, logs and profiles are rarely tested.

Who is asserting in unit test if log or trace was produced for certain even and if it has certain message.
It's not always true but logs are usually used by humans so there is no point in checking exact message.

With metrics in my opinion it's totally different story. They has to be tested. Let me explain in second why.

<Notes>

1) Ok let's take our http requests example.
2) And let's take some portion of loadbalancer logic. Again, We have RoundTripper that takes
targets from discovery, picks one from the list, forwards the request and marks the host
it forwarded to in a response header.
And below we have ServeHTTP handler which again increment our metric while recording the status code.
3) Now let's imagine someone introduce a bug. A bug that wrongly records every replica status code to 200.
This is scary as our e.g graph will not show any errors while clearly there is a problem with loadbalancing.
If we have alert on errors it will not notify us as well so our monitoring is not reliable (!!!)
4) And of course our loadbalancer have already a unit test using nice table test pattern right?
5) We have some test cases with different loadbalancing situations, for example loadbalancer error.
6) For each test case we fire a request and check if loadbalancer redirected and proxy response with the right
code. We also check if it picked expected host.
But, will that catch our bug with metric?
7) Not really in case where replica sends 502, metric will have actually 200 code which is wrong as you can see.
We expect http_request_total{code="502"} being incremented instead.
And unfortunately our tests returns success instead, so is missing validation for metrics! Let's fix this.
8) Let's fix this. Let's use awesome testutil package from Prometheus client!
9) Let's add metric instance and assertion in no metric, since we did not sen any requests yet, we expect nothing as well.
so we technically assert on cardinality of this metrics - so how many metrics it will produce - 0 means no metric.
10) We add expectation for each case, that our metric for 502 should be 1
11) We assert on this vs expectations using ToFloat64 function for http requests total metric 502 and check that
nothing else was incremented.
12) Now our test will fail as expected, noticing that the metric was incremented incorrectly!

We really recommend to extend your normal tests with metrics assertion for all your crucial metrics.

Lack of consistency. So there are some useful methods on what metrics you should define
for your system, usually a web servers. The four golden signals from SRE book, USE method, RED method.

There are two advantages to follow them:

- This helps to be sure you have main signals upfront of potential debugging or alerting needs.
- It helps to reuse common alerts, recording rules and dashboards. e.g mixin project. If you are following
the same method.

1) Let's focus on one method. For example RED: R stands for rps, E for err, D for dur.

<Notes>

1) Does our Server Metrics satisfy RED method?
2) We have certainly requests
3) Errors when code is not 200
4) But duration is missing!
5) To satisfy RED method we can easily add histogram which will observe latency of the whole service.
Now our loadbalancer has consistent metrics and can reuse RED dashboards, alerts and recording rule which
is awesome.

Now I will pass mic to Kemal.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 10px 0 10px;">Pitfall #5: Unbounded Cardinality</h2>

<Notes>

KEMAL

When we talk about Prometheus it always comes down to cardinality.

What is cardinality actually? So the cardinality, in Prometheus context, is the amount of unique time-series you have in youir system.

And don't forget each label value that you add to your metric creates another time=series.

So for example, if you have a label containing HTTP methods would have a cardinality of 2 if you had only GET and POST in your application.

Labels what make Prometheus stong. However you should always watch out how you use them.
Things could get out of control pretty quickly.

Let's see an example.

KEMAL

Let's define a metric called `conntrackdialer_conn_failed_total`, to track the number of failed connections we have in our loadbalancer.

And let's have a label called `reason` to track failure reasons.

And then open our connection and whatever needs to be done and if we fail, let's increment our metric with corresponding error.

Everything looks good, let's run our loadbalancer and get our metrics.

<Notes>

KEMAL

That is not what we expacted.
What went wrong?

We shoudn't use arbitrary data as label values.

We should always keep them in bounds.

A better approach would be to predefine them.

So let's see how we can fix it.

<h2 style="text-align: center; margin: 0 10px 0 10px;">Pitfall #4: Not Initialized Metrics</h2>

<Notes>

KEMAL

Another common pitfall is not to initialize your metrics with labels.

Let's have a look at an example.

</Notes>

<CodeSurfer>

```go title="Not initializing Metrics" subtitle="Define a metric"

type DialerMetrics struct {
	connFailedTotal      *prometheus.CounterVec
}

func NewDialerMetrics(reg prometheus.Registerer) *DialerMetrics {
	m := &DialerMetrics{
		connFailedTotal: prometheus.NewCounterVec(
			prometheus.CounterOpts{
				Subsystem: "conntrack",

			}, []string{"reason"}),
	}

	if reg != nil {
		reg.MustRegister(m.connClosedTotal)
	}

	return m
}

```

```go subtitle=""
m.connFailedTotal.WithLabelValues("unknown").Add(30)
```

</CodeSurfer>

<Notes>

As always let's start with defining a metric.

1)
An for this example as well let's use the same metric that we got familiar with `conntrack_dialer_conn_failed_total`.

2)
Let's set a value with a specfic reason for this counter.

</Notes>

import uninitialized_metrics from './static/uninitialized_metrics.png'

KEMAL

As you can see, although we have our increment metric.

We do not see the actual change with our `increase` function.

</Notes>

import uninitialized_metrics_marked from './static/uninitialized_metrics_marked.png'

<Image src={uninitialized_metrics_marked} size='contain'/>

<Notes>

KEMAL

This is not something we want.

</Notes>

---

<Notes>

KEMAL

Let's fix this.

1)
We can start with predefining our labels as constants.
This is not strictly necessary but it always helps me.

2)
And then let's use `WithLabelValues` method to initialize our counters.

3)
Let's run it again see what happens.
